abstract: "BACKGROUND: Intrathecal morphine provides effective analgesia after cesarean birth, yet up to 90% of women who receive it experience excessive itching, an  undesirable dose-dependent effect. Pruritis may increase nursing workload, delay  breastfeeding, and decrease patient satisfaction. When 0.1 mg spinal morphine is  given, pruritis is markedly reduced while analgesia is preserved. PURPOSE: The  purpose of this project was to determine possible causes and solutions for  pruritus after cesarean birth. METHODS: Anesthesia providers were educated and  encouraged to limit spinal morphine to 0.1 mg as a strategy to prevent pruritus.  In a repeated measures design, the rate of treatment-required pruritus and opioid  consumption were measured 24 hours after surgery. The project included an  evaluation of 30 medical records before and 30 medical records after the project  intervention. RESULTS: Preintervention rate of treatment-required pruritis was  37%, all received spinal morphine â‰¥ 1.5 mg. Postintervention rate of  treatment-required pruritis was 13% and 57% after spinal morphine 0.1 mg and 0.2  mg, respectively. Opioid consumption was similar between groups. CLINICAL  IMPLICATIONS: Mother-baby nurses can have an impact on the practice of anesthesia  providers by advocating for evidence-based dosing of intrathecal morphine to  reduce the incidence of pruritis while maintaining effective analgesia for women  after cesarean birth."
