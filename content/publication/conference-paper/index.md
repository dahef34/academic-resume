abstract: Recent aggression in Ukraine has demonstrated the potential need for anesthesia in austere environments where temperature alternates above and below the freezing point of many anesthesia medications. A common anesthetic propofol comes in several formulations that all differ by the antimicrobial additive. One study to date demonstrated a difference in emulsion stability between two different formulations but this study has not been replicated for newer formulations. 1 Our research team studied the effects of multiple freeze thaw cycles on propofol with sodium metabisulMte vs Diprivan with EDTA. Our preliminary results indicate significant bottle-to-bottle variability in both formulations with the majority of molecules being less than 5μm but containing some globular formations as large as 100μm. Significant variability in the pH of propofol with sodium metabisulMte was noted and found to be outside of the manufacturer’s stated pH.
