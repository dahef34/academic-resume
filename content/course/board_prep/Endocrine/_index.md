## Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic medical condition in which the body is unable to produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar (glucose) levels. Insulin is produced by cells in the pancreas called beta cells. In people with type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys these beta cells, leading to a deficiency of insulin in the body.

The exact process by which the immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas is not fully understood. However, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is known that people with type 1 diabetes have certain genetic markers that increase their risk of developing the condition. However, these markers do not guarantee that a person will develop type 1 diabetes. It is thought that certain environmental factors, such as viral infections or other triggers, may interact with a person's genetics to cause the immune system to attack the beta cells.

### Diagnosis

A diagnosis of diabetes can be made with one of threee tests: a fasting plasma glucose (FPG), an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), random plasma glucose, or a Hemoglobin A1C test.  The diagnostic criteria for each test is listed below.  Random plasma glucose guidelines follow those for OGTT.


|  Test  |  Criteria    |
| ----------------------|
|  FPG  |  >= 126 mg/dL |
|  OGTT |  >= 200 mg/dL |
|  A1C  |  >= 6.5%      |

Only plasma glucose testing should be utilized in diseases that have an abnormal interaction between A1C and glycemia, such as hemaglobinopathies including sickle cell disease, pregnancy, G6PD, dialysis, or recent transfusion.
