# Endocrine System

## Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic medical condition in which the body is unable to produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar (glucose) levels. Insulin is produced by cells in the pancreas called beta cells. In people with type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys these beta cells, leading to a deficiency of insulin in the body.

The exact process by which the immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas is not fully understood. However, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is known that people with type 1 diabetes have certain genetic markers that increase their risk of developing the condition. However, these markers do not guarantee that a person will develop type 1 diabetes. It is thought that certain environmental factors, such as viral infections or other triggers, may interact with a person's genetics to cause the immune system to attack the beta cells.

### Diagnosis

A diagnosis of diabetes can be made with one of threee tests: a fasting plasma glucose (FPG), an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), random plasma glucose, or a Hemoglobin A1C test.  The diagnostic criteria for each test is listed below.  Random plasma glucose guidelines follow those for OGTT.


|  Test  |  Criteria    |
| ------| ---------------|
|  FPG  |  >= 126 mg/dL |
|  OGTT |  >= 200 mg/dL |
|  A1C  |  >= 6.5%      |

Only plasma glucose testing should be utilized in diseases that have an abnormal interaction between A1C and glycemia, such as hemaglobinopathies including sickle cell disease, pregnancy, G6PD, dialysis, or recent transfusion.

### Perioperative treatment goals

Treatment goals vary depending on the organization.  Two of the most pertinent to anesthesia are guidelines from the Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia (SAMBA) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS).

|  Organization  |  Goal    |
| ------| ---------------|
|  SAMBA  |  < 180 mg/dL |
|  STS |  < 180 mg/dL (intraoperative) <br> <= 110 in fasting state |

### Oral Medication Recommendations

Current oral diabetic medication recommendations for elective surgery are as follows:

|  Medication          |  Day Before Surgery    |  Ambulatory Surgery    |  Extensive Surgery |
| -----------          | :---------------:      | :-----------------:    |    :------------:  |

"An IV insulin infusion is recommended in patients undergoing procedures with anticipated hemodynamic changes, significant fluid shifts, expected changes in temperature (passive hypothermia or active cooling, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy), use of inotropes, or lengthy operative times (greater than 4â€‰h)."1

#### Insulin Pumps

Unless the surgical site or procedure procludes the use of an insulin pump, the pump should be continued on the day of surgery.  Turn the pump off if the BG is less than 110 mg/dL and provide additional bolus of insulin if BG > 180.  If unable to use the insulin pump, an insulin infusion can be substituted at the same rate as the basal rate on the pump.
