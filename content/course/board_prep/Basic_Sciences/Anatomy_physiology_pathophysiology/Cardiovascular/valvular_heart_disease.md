## Valvular Heart Disease

Reference the [2020 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000923#d1e434)

Let's start by looking at the normal anatomy and the function of each part.  The heart is divided into 4 chambers (2 Atrium / 2 Ventricles) with a septum dividing the right and left heart.  Between the atria and ventricles lie the aptly named atrioventricular valves or the tricuspid and mitral valves.  The tricuspid valve has 3 cusps as it says in the name and the mitral valve gets its name from a bishops mitre if this helps you remember it with 2 flaps.

At first, I mistakenly thought it was named after a miter joint where two pieces of wood are joined at an angle to form a strong joint.  Either way remember that it typically has two leaflets.

These leafelets are attached to the papillary muscles in the ventricles by chordae tendinae as illustrated in the picture below.  These connections are only in the atrioventricular valves because without them the valves would almost certainly fail with the force of blood ejection during systole.  The aortic and pulmonic valves are called semilunar valves and each typically have 3 leaflets.

 The aortic valve has 2 anterior leaflets and 1 posterior leaflet.  
 The pulmonic valve has 2 posterior leaflets and 1 anterior leaflet.

## Aortic stenosis
[AHA Aortic Stenosis Recommendations](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000923#d1e4306)

AS is the most common cardiac valve lesion in the United States and as the population is living longer this surgery has become more prevalent.  Up to 2% of the population can have a congenital bicuspid aortic valve which significantly increases the odds of developing stenosis and eventually needing repair.  The normal valve area is 2.5 - 3.5 cmÂ² and significant stenosis occurs < 1.2 cmÂ².  Critical stenosis is < 0.7 cmÂ².  Survival without surgery is estimated at 2-5 years after symptom onset.  The left ventricle gets stronger and thickens due to the increasing workload of pumping blood through the stenotic valve.  Eventually this ***concentric*** thickening will lead to decreased myocardial contractility and left ventricular function will become comprimised.

## Aortic regurgitation

[AHA Aortic Regurgitation Recommendations](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000923#d1e5782)

#### ***Full, Fast, Forward***

Aortic regurgitation / insufficiency happens when an incopetent aortic valve allows blood to come back into the heart from the aorta during diastole.  It is usually linked to insidious disease processes in the elderly, but can be a consequence of rheumatic heart disease or infective endocarditis.  
It is divided into 4 stages:
- Stage A: Patients at risk for aortic insufficiency.
- Stage B: Patients with progressive mild to moderate aortic insufficiency.
- Stage C: Patients with asymptomatic and severe aortic insufficiency
    - Stage C1 patients have a left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 50% and mild to moderate left ventricular dilation with an end-systolic dimension less than 50 mm.
    - Stage C2 patients have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50% and severe left ventricular dilation with an end-systolic dimension more than 50 mm or an indexed left ventricular end-systolic dimension more than 25 mm/m2.
- Stage D: Patients with symptomatic and severe AR.

## Mitral stenosis

[AHA Mitral Stenosis Recommendations](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000923#d1e6762)

Mitral stenosis is a narrowing of the mitral valve area.  It is usually caused by rheumatic disease.  Most patients will have another co-morbid valvular disease (aortic or mitral regurgitation)

It is divided into 4 stages:
- Stage A: Patients at risk of MS
- Stage B: Patients with progressive MS (e.g. rheumatic valve changes with commissural fusion, diastolic doming of the mitral valve leaflets, mitral valve area > 1.5 cmÂ².
- Stage C: Asymptomatic Severe MS Mitral valve area â‰¤ 1.5 cmÂ²
- Stage D: Symptomatic Severe MS Mitral valve area â‰¤ 1.5 cmÂ²

Management goals are similar to AS:

| Goals	| Avoid	 | 
| ----------------  | :------ | 
|Sinus rhythm	| Avoid atrial fibrillation or other SVT  <br> Avoid loss of artial kick (e.g. junctional rhythm, V-pacing)                                |   
|Normal HR (60 to 90 bpm)	| Avoid tachycardia <br>  Avoid profound bradycardia <br> Avoid junctional rhythm                              |   
|Maintain afterload	| Avoid hypotension/hypertension <br>   Avoid sympathectomy                           |   
|Maintain preload	| Avoid hypovolemia            |
|Maintain volume status	| Replete hemorrhage                              |   
|Maintain contractility	| Avoid myocardial depressants                              |

## Mitral Regurgitation

[AHA Mitral Regurgitation Recommendations](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000923#d1e7466)

#### ***Full, Fast, Forward***

It is divided into 4 stages:
- Stage A: At risk of MR - Mild mitral valve prolapse with normal coaptation.
- Stage B: Progressive MR - Severe mitral valve prolapse with normal coaptation.
- Stage C: Asymptomatic severe MR - Severe mitral valve prolapse with loss of coaptation or flail leaflet
- Stage D: Symptomatic severe MR - Severe mitral valve prolapse with loss of coaptation or flail leaflet and exertional dyspnea
