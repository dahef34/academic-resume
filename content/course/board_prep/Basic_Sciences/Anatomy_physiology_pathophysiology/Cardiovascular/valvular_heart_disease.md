## Valvular Heart Disease
{{< figure src="CG_Heart.gif" caption="Cross-section of heart pumping" numbered="true" >}}

Let's start by looking at the normal anatomy and the function of each part.  The heart is divided into 4 chambers (2 Atrium / 2 Ventricles) with a septum dividing the right and left heart.  Between the atria and ventricles lie the aptly named atrioventricular valves or the tricuspid and mitral valves.  The tricuspid valve has 3 cusps as it says in the name and the mitral valve gets its name from a bishops mitre if this helps you remember it with 2 flaps.

At first, I mistakenly thought it was named after a miter joint where two pieces of wood are joined at an angle to form a strong joint.  Either way remember that it typically has two leaflets.

These leafelets are attached to the papillary muscles in the ventricles by chordae tendinae as illustrated in the picture below.  These connections are only in the atrioventricular valves because without them the valves would almost certainly fail with the force of blood ejection during systole.  The aortic and pulmonic valves are called semilunar valves and each typically have 3 leaflets.

 The aortic valve has 2 anterior leaflets and 1 posterior leaflet.  
 The pulmonic valve has 2 posterior leaflets and 1 anterior leaflet.

## Aortic stenosis

AS is the most common cardiac valve lesion in the United States and as the population is living longer this surgery has become more prevalent.  Up to 2% of the population can have a congenital bicuspid aortic valve which significantly increases the odds of developing stenosis and eventually needing repair.  The normal valve area is 2.5 - 3.5 cmÂ² and significant stenosis occurs < 1.2 cmÂ².  Critical stenosis is < 0.7 cmÂ².  Survival without surgery is estimated at 2-5 years after symptom onset.  The left ventricle gets stronger and thickens due to the increasing workload of pumping blood through the stenotic valve.  Eventually this ***concentric*** thickening will lead to decreased myocardial contractility and left ventricular function will become comprimised.

 Aortic stenosis causes a ***PRESSURE*** overload which leads to ***CONCENTRIC*** hypertrophy.
