## Pericarditis
Typically at least two of the following criteria should be present for a diagnosis of pericarditis:
1. Characteristic chest pain
    - Sudden onset, retrosternal, and exacerbated by inspiration.  Often lessened by leaning forward or sitting in upright position.
2. Pericardial friction rub
    - A high-pitched scratchy or squeaky sound heard best at the left sternal boarder.
3. Suggestive EKG changes
    - Wide-spread upward concave ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression.
4. Pericardial effusion
    - TEE is recommended to rule out effusion and cardiac tamponade

### Treatment
Treatment for acute pericarditis secondary to a non-viral identifiable cause is treatment of the underlying cause.  For all viral and idiopathic causes a 3-armed approach is recommended with 1.  NSAIDS, 2. Colchicine, & 3. Corticosteroids.  All treatments are aimed at relieving inflammation and pain.  Although corticosteroids are controversial as they are also an independent risk factor for recurrents so their use if reserved for cases that fail NSAID and colchicine therapy.



## Cardiac tamponade
Cardiac tamponade is a continuation of pericardial effusion where all cardiac chambers are compromised due to the increased intracardial pressure so significantly so that venous return to the right atrium is affected.  Cardiac tamponade should be suspected in patients with shock that have JVD and/or PEA.



## Constrictive pericarditis
Constrictive pericarditis can be idiopathic, a sequelae of cardiac surgery or mediastinal radiation therapy, or from tuberculosis.  This generally presents as diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic function.  Restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is more rare can originate from sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, or radiation and results in a rigid myocardium with a decrease in myocardial compliance.
