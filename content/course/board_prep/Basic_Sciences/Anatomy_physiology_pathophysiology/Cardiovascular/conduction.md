## Cardiac Cycle

The cardiac cycle runs from the beginning of one hearbeat to the beginning of the next. The cycle begins in ventricular diastole just after the end of the t-wave on the ekg.  The ventricles are passively filling with blood from the atria.  The next phase (atrial systole) begins with atrial contraction which should show a p-wave on the ekg waveform.  Ventricular systole quickly follows afterwards with a QRS complex now showing on the ekg waveform.  Then the cycle repeats.

## Cardiac Output

Cardiac output is the quantity of blood pumped by each ventricle per minute.
