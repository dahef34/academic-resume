{{% spoiler text="Due to an __________ displacement of the stomach and increased ____________ that relaxes the lower esophageal spincter approximately ___% of pregnant women experience GERD." %}}
Due to an upward displacement of the stomach and increased progesterone that relaxes the lower esophageal spincter approximately 50% of pregnant women experience GERD.
{{% /spoiler %}}

{{% spoiler text="Risk factors for GERD in pregnancy include:" %}}
Risk factors for GERD in pregnancy include gestational age, heartburn antecedent to pregnancy, and multiparity.

{{% spoiler text="The _______ ________ sound is accentuated with exaggerated splitting of the mitral and tricuspid components" %}}
The FIRST HEART sound is accentuated with exaggerated splitting of the mitral and tricuspid components
{{% /spoiler %}}


{{% spoiler text="There could be a ___ and ___ heart sound with little clinical significance" %}}
There could be a S3 and S4 heart sound with little clinical significance

{{% spoiler text="Stroke volume increases by ___% in the first trimester and up to ___% by the second trimester and correlates with increasing ___________levels." %}}
Stroke volume increases by 20% in the first trimester and up to 30% by the second trimester and correlates with increasing estrogen levels.
{{% /spoiler %}}

{{% spoiler text="Ejection fraction increaeses during pregnancy due to:" %}}
Ejection fraction increases during pregnancy due to an increase in end-diastolic volume.  End-systolic volume remains unchanged.

Uterine blood flow increases from 50 ml/min to up to 900 ml/min at term.

### Lung

The hormone responsible for relaxation of the pelvic ligaments also affects the chest wall resulting in an increase in subcostal angles and an increase in chest wall diameter.  Due to this alteration in anatomy, airflow is almost entirely related to movement of the diaphragm.  Pulmonary resistance is decreased by 50%, but most respiratory parameters remain largely unchanged with notable exceptions.[2]  FRC begins to decrease by the 5th month and drops to 80% of the pre-pregnancy value at term with a greater reduction in ERV than RV.[^2]
