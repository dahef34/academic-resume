# One Lung Ventilation

One lung ventilation is a technique used during surgery when operating in the thoracic cavity.  Depending on the surgical requirements, the area being operated on, and the patient's ability to tolerate one lung ventilation, different techniques and adjuncts can be used.  There are relative and absolute indications and contraindications to each technique and we will discuss some of the most common equipment used and the placement techniques.  Different methods of lung isolation include the use of double lumen tubes, single lumen tubes, and single lumen tubes with bronchial blockers.

## Indications

### Absolute
 - Control of foreign material such as abcess, blood, infection
 - Broncho-pleural fistula
 - Broncho-pulmonary lavage
 - Bullectomy
 - Surgery on trachea or bronchus
 - Lung transplantation
 - Parenchymal disease

 ### Relative
 - Lung resection
 - Esophageal surgery
 - Vascular surgery
 - VATS
 - Spine surgery
 - Pleurodesis

 ## Contraindications

 ### Absolute
 - Intraluminal tracheal tumors


 ### Relative
- Significant lung disease (intolerance of OLV)
- Pre-existing pulmonary hypertension

## Double Lumen Tube

The double lumen tube comes in right and left variants due to the anatomical differences between the right and left mainstem bronchus.  In clinical practice, a left double lumen tube is preferred for both sides except in situations that would necessitate a right double lumen tube such as surgery on the left mainstem bronchus due to the increase in ease of placement of these tubes as well as a higher margin of error with tube placement location due to the longer left main stem bronchus.

These tubes range in size from 26 - 41 Fr.  The most common tube sizes for adults range from 37 - 39, but size selection should be individualized per patient.


## Single Lumen Tube

A traditional single lumen tube can be used for certain types of one lung ventilation where lung isolation is not paramount (Pleurodesis, VATS, etc.).  This simply involves placing a regular endotracheal tube into the mainstem bronchus of the non-operative lung.  To enable first-pass placement in the corect side a fiberoptic optic bronchoscope is typically used and ETT size selection should adjusted for the size of the mainstem bronchus.  This approach has some notable disadvantages such as inability to precisely control or add CPAP to the operative lung if necessary for oxygenation, an open conduit from the mouth to the operative lung exists, and limited ability to add CPAP to the operative lung if necessary for oxygenation.  Due to these restrictions, this technique is not recommended unless the situation dictates.


## Bronchial Blocker

Bronchial blockers are medical devices used to isolate a specific part of the bronchial tree during certain medical procedures. They are commonly placed with bronchoscopy.  The bronchial blocker expands and seals off the bronchial lumen, allowing for isolation of a specific part of the bronchial tree for surgery.  Bronchial blockers have some purported drawbacks, they seem to be less stable than a DTL frequently needing to be repositioned to maintain an adequate seal, they can be more difficult to place since they are typically placed with a fiberoptic bronchoscope instead of just verifying placement like with a DLT, and typically have more problems providing complete deflation of the operative lung.  These purported drawbacks have not been demonstrated experimentally and at least one study has demonstrated some advantages to the bronchial blocker such as a reduction in sore throat.
